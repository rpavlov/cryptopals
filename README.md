# Cryptopals solutions

I've been meaning to 1. Learn more python, 2. Increase my understanding of cryptography and 3. Prune my backlog of 'interesting stuff to checkout someday maybe'. To that end, I'm gonna jump into the https://cryptopals.com challenges.

Accompanying blog post with concepts and notes over yonder: https://rpavlov.com/2019/06/07/cryptopals/

## Notes
* Ciphertext: result of running a piece of text throught a Cipher, otherwise known as an algorithm.
* In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis (also known as counting letters) is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.
* Summarize the example in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis
